    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an experienced 1C developer who would like to change the working stack. 
      Nevertheless, I consider that my experience and understanding of development principles will be useful in any case.
      I also have some production experience in the frontend development, after which I realized that the backend side is closer to me.
      In order to prepare for this transition I studied Java Basic and also completed a study project. 
      For this project I learned Spring Boot and other technologies. More details can be found in the Projects section.
